# First-ever Ukrainian House in Finland 1

We are eager to share the Ukrainian culture with Finland. With this in mind, we’ve decided to establish a one-of-a-kind **Ukraina Talo** in Tampere.

With the help of volunteers, relocated Ukrainians, local companies, and the city government we are opening a space where Finns and Ukrainians can share each other’s culture, learn, relax and simply feel at home.

Ukraina Talo will feature a daycare, a library, a classroom, and an open space with various activities. While we focus our Ukraina Talo efforts on helping relocated Ukrainians - our doos are open to everyone.
